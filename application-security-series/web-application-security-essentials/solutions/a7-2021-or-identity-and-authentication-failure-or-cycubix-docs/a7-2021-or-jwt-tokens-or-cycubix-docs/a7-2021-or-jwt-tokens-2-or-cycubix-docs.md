The token is base64 encoded and consists of three parts:

* header
* claims
* signature

Both header and claims consist are represented by a JSON object. The header describes the cryptographic operations applied to the JWT and optionally, additional properties of the JWT. The claims represent a JSON object whose members are the claims conveyed by the JWT.
