## Solution

The HTTP request observed in the previous exercise was a POST message. The magic number is hidden in the web page's JavaScript. One of the methods to view this is to right click on the web page and select "Inspect".

In the "Body" section, search for the phrase "magic" until you identify the value stored by the hidden `magic_num` field.
