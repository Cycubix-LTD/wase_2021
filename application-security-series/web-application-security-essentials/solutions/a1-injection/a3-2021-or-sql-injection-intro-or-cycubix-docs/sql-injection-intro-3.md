# A3:2021 | SQL Injection  Intro (3)  | Cycubix Docs

As implied by the name, data manipulation language deals with the manipulation of data. Many of the most common SQL statements, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, may be categorized as DML statements. DML statements may be used for requesting records (SELECT), adding records (INSERT), deleting records (DELETE), and modifying existing records (UPDATE).

If an attacker succeeds in "injecting" DML statements into a SQL database, he can violate the confidentiality (using SELECT statements), integrity (using UPDATE statements), and availability (using DELETE or UPDATE statements) of a system.

* DML commands are used for storing, retrieving, modifying, and deleting data.
* SELECT - retrieve data from a database
* INSERT - insert data into a database
* UPDATE - updates existing data within a database
* DELETE - delete records from a database
* Example:
  * Retrieve data:
  * SELECT phone\
    FROM employees\
    WHERE userid = 96134;
  * This statement retrieves the phone number of the employee who has the userid 96134.
