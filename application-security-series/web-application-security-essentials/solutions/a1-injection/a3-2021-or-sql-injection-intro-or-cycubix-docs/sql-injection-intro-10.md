### Try It! Numeric SQL injection <a href="#try_it_numeric_sql_injection" id="try_it_numeric_sql_injection"></a>

The query in the code builds a dynamic query as seen in the previous example. The query in the code builds a dynamic query by concatenating a number making it susceptible to Numeric SQL injection:

```
"SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE login_count = " + Login_Count + " AND userid = "  + User_ID;
```

Using the two Input Fields below, try to retrieve all the data from the users table.

Warning: Only one of these fields is susceptible to SQL Injection. You need to find out which, to successfully retrieve all the data.

#### Solution

* The User\_ID at the end is not part of the STRING so its going to be our vulnerable field.&#x20;
* We need to find statements that follows a technique for evaluating truth. We can insert 0 in the loging account and 1 OR 0=0.&#x20;
* Hint:  You do not need to insert any quotations into your injection-string.
* &#x20;**Login\_count**: `0`
