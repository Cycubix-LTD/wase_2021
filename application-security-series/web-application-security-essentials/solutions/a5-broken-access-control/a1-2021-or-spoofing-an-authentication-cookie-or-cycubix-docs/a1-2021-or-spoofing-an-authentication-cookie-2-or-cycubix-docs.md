# A1:2021 | Spoofing an Authentication Cookie (2) | Cycubix Docs

Attempt to bypass the authentication mechanism by spoofing an authentication cookie.

**Notes about the login system**

* When a valid authentication cookie is received, the system will automatically log in the user.
* If a cookie is not sent, but the provided credentials are correct, the system will generate an authentication cookie.
* Login attempts will be denied under any other circumstances.

\*Please pay close attention to the feedback messages you receive during the attacks.\*

Known credentials:

| user name | password |
| --------- | -------- |
| webgoat   | webgoat  |
| admin     | admin    |

**Goal**

Once you have a clear understanding of how the authentication cookie is generated, attempt to _spoof_ the cookie and log in as Tom.

**Solution**

* Turn on the Interceptor (Burp) or Break (ZAP).
* Enter the known user credentials (webgoat/admin).&#x20;
* What results you can compare: WebGoat and Admin have their own spoofed cookie but as you continue to log in you will notice that the spoof cookie for each login maintains its value.&#x20;

Admin Cookie= NDE1MTc5NjI3MjU3NTg1NTRjNTc2ZTY5NmQ2NDYx

WebGoat Cookie= NDE1MTc5NjI3MjU3NTg1NTRjNTc3NDYxNmY2NzYyNjU3Nw==

What is the encoding Scheme?: [https://www.base64decode.org/](https://www.base64decode.org/)

* After you encode the spoofed cookies into UTF-8 you will receive the folowing values:&#x20;

Admin= 41517962725758554c576e696d6461

WebGoat= 41517962725758554c5774616f67626577

* UTF-8 encodes in HEX values, meaning in 8 BITS. We can use a Converter from HEX to Text ([https://codebeautify.org/hex-string-converter](https://codebeautify.org/hex-string-converter)).&#x20;

Admin spoofed cookie into text= AQybrWXULW**nimda**

WebGoat spoofed cookie into text= AQybrWXULW**taogbew**

We can see the characteristics of the encoding values, keeping the first part the same and spelling backwards the user name.&#x20;

* Now go to the section of string reverser on CodeBeautify to reverse the string:&#x20;

Admin= adminWLUXWrbyQA

WebGoat= webgoatWLUXWrbyQA

* Now replace on the reversed string Admin or WebGoat into TOM.&#x20;

AQybrWXULWmoT

* Then go back to the section of String to HEX in CodeBeautify, and encode the above string.&#x20;

41517962725758554c576d6f54

* Go into the Base64Encode Website and Encode the string into UTF-8.&#x20;

NDE1MTc5NjI3MjU3NTg1NTRjNTc2ZDZmNTQ=

* How do we authenticate the new authentication cookie?&#x20;

Find the corresponding POST request. Forward it to the Repeater (Burp) or Manual Reuqest Editor (ZAP).&#x20;

Add after Cookie JSESSIONID the spoofed authentication.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/cookie spoof ok 1.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Send the Request and you will get the following message:&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/cookie spoof ok 2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

With the manipulation of the authenticated cookie we can now impersonate another user, in this case TOM. &#x20;
