# A1:2021 | Missing Function Level Access Control (2) | Cycubix Docs

Relying on Obscurity

If you are relying on HTML, CSS or javascript to hide links that users don’t normally access. It’s a little older, but there was a case of a network router trying to protect (hide) admin functions with javascript in the UI [https://www.wired.com/2009/10/routers-still-vulnerable](https://www.wired.com/2009/10/routers-still-vulnerable)

#### Finding Hidden Items <a href="#finding_hidden_items" id="finding_hidden_items"></a>

There are usually hints to finding functionality the UI (User Interface) does not openly expose in:

* HTML or javascript comments.
* Commented out elements.
* Items hidden via css controls/classes.

#### Your Mission <a href="#your_mission" id="your_mission"></a>

Find two menu items not visible in menu below that are or would be of interest to an attacker/malicious user and put the labels for those menu items (there are no links right now in the menus).

The following capture will show you what the user can see:&#x20;

* Open the developer tools and go to Inspect Element.&#x20;
* Look for indications of something that would not be available to a typical user. Such as:

* Type "Users" and "Config" in the responses.&#x20;
