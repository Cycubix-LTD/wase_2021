# A9:2021 | Logging Security (4) | Cycubix Docs

#### Let’s try <a href="#lets_try" id="lets_try"></a>

* Some servers provide Administrator credentials at the boot-up of the server.
* The goal of this challenge is to find the secret in the application log of the WebGoat server to login as the Admin user.
* Note that we tried to "protect" it. Can you decode it?

**Solution**

* Click on submit and open the developer tools. You will be able to identify the post request under the session "log-bleeding". 
* Now, open the terminal of your docker container, where you started your WebGoat session and look for the password for admin.
